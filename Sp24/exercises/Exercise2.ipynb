Then, ask the user to supply five numbers of that many digits separated by spaces. Parse these numbers out, and calculate sum and mean as in part A. Try doing this without using any additional variables! (Use only the one that contains the string that you read in - this will need advanced slicing skills!)"

    "Your boss has asked you to do a small bioinformatics project on the protein LeuT (pdb code 2Q6H), which is the neurotransmitter responsible for transporting antidepressants. Every protein is made of a string of molecules known as amino acids, and we want to examine how many and what types of amino acids are present in the protein LeuT. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need the data file storing the information on the protein LeuT. Protein Databank (PDB) structure files containing the amino acid sequence are stored at http://www.rcsb.org/. While we have provided the PDB file under `resources/` for you copy into your folder, try and see if you can download the file yourself! Use the pdb code (2Q6H) to find the file at the RCSB website. After searching the code, on the resulting page, use Download Files >> PDB Format (don't use the one with the 'gz' option) to download the PDB file onto your computer. __Then, move the structure file into your `resources/` directory using Jupyter Notebook's upload option.__\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't know how to open files in Python yet that don't have a spreadsheet format, so to help you out, we have provided a script (see below) that will read in a file and save the amino acid sequence to a list called `protSeq1` and a dictionary called `protSeq2`. I have commented the code, but there are many things in here you haven't learned yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the code below, you can access the `protSeq1` and `protSeq2` variables (you may need to rewrite the file path if you get an error and it says you can't find the file - it should work if you set it up like I did in your `resources/` folder). We ended the script with a `print` statement so you can see an ordered list of amino acids for the LeuT protein. \n",
    "\n",
    "A. Uncomment the last `print` statement and run the script. Examine the list that results from `protSeq1`. Explain what datatype is stored in the list. \n",

    "B. Add code to the script to calculate how many amino acids are in the protein (i.e. the total number of elements in the list). \n",

    "\n",
    "D. Run the code in the cell after you make the `protSeq1` and `protSeq2` variables. Explain what each of the four rows are doing, and compare the functions used to what you learned in Lesson 2. Note that there are differences! Determine what new things this script shows you. \n",
    "\n",
    "E. Analyze the graph - what amino acid is most frequent in LeuT? Least frequent? (For Bio kids, are there are any patterns to the types of amino acids that are most or least frequent?)"
