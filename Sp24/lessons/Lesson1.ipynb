    "Welcome to this Python workshop. Dr. Mel Yang has been running this Python Bootcamp for years, and now Dr. Steph Spera is bringing some geography to the mix. Over the semester, you will learn the basics of python, with examples that include biological (mostly genetics) and geography content (mostly physical geography).  This course is going to be presented in jupyter notebook, which we'll talk about later! \n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these lessons are directly taken or adapted from a Python bootcamp at UC Berkeley that Dr. Yang helped to teach from 2012-2016. She has also taught these lessons the summer of 2017 at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and has been tinkering with this throughout her time at UR with her students. Dr. Spera is bringing some of her own working knowledge, and some lessons based on resources from CU-Boulder and the University of Wisconsin. We ask that the biology students be open to learning some geography, geography students be open to learning some biology, and everyone just embrace learning and flexibility. \n",

    "The idea behind these lessons is to create an environment for you to intensively work on developing your python programming skills and give you a crash course in the basics of the language. By the end of the course, you will not be an expert on python, but you should be able to write simple scripts and have the groundwork and general vocabulary to effectively use the internet and/or other resources to teach you fancier tricks. Most importantly, if you have a science question, you should to start envisioning what ways you can write code that will help you arrive at an answer. \n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. Navigating Linux <a name='bookmark2' />\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we touch any python, we have to go over Linux. Linux is an open-source operating system (similar to Windows or a macOS). It manages hardware resources, facilitates communication between softtware and hardware, and provides a user interface for interactions. It is WIDELY used, particularly when servers and clusters are involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shell is the the way you interact with your operating system. Most of you are used to the graphical user interface (GUI) you see when you turn on a computer - clicking the Start button allows you to access a folder, which contains files that you double click to open within the relevant default application. However, there is a command line user interface (CLI) that is very useful as well. Both Linux and Mac operating systems use the CLI **Terminal**, in which we use the Linux language for navigation. In Windows operating system, this CLI is the **Command Prompt**, which uses a different language. However, Windows 10 and higher now have a Terminal software installed that uses Linux. If you have an older Windows interface, installation of other CLIs like cygwin or MobaXTerm will allow you to use UNIX in a Windows computer - let us know if you need this. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next vital piece in writing python code is a text editor. Python code is usually written to a text file ending in \".py\", and then you can use the Linux commands to access and run the python script from your shell (Terminal). Sometimes, you may also want to use an interpreter, or a program that allows you to directly execute commands without calling on a script you save to file. Here, we will gain familiarity with the Linux language, and below, learn how to use Jupyter Notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "During this semester, we will work from UR's remote cluster, *Spydur*. It is ideal because you should not need any new software (unless you have an old version of Windows, which we can deal with), and all you do need is an internet connection, and if you're off campus, UR's VPN. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, we want to make sure you are a user on the Spydur cluster and can access the directory `/scratch/myang_shared/lab/`. In the next section, you will see if you can log into Spydur and access the directory. "

    "### A. 'Address already in use' (after running the `ssh -N -f -L` command)\n",
    "\n",
    "After you submit the job to run your Jupyter Notebook on Spydur (using `qsub`), you next open a Terminal on your laptop to 'tunnel' to your Jupyter Notebook job using `ssh -N -f -L ####:spdr59:#### username@spydur`. However, sometimes, you accidentally run the tunneling command more than once. If you do, this may cause an error where the Terminal screen prints out something similar to the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "bind [127.0.0.1]:8890: Address already in use\n",
    "channel_setup_fwd_listener_tcpip: cannot listen to port: 8890\n",
    "Could not request local forwarding.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If this happens, you want to reset kill all current jobs on your laptop using `ssh -N -f -L` and redo the process. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, enter `ps aux | grep spydur` on the Terminal screen NOT logged into Spydur. You should see a list of all jobs on your laptop that have the term 'spydur' in it (you will probably see more than one). Find the rows with the `ssh -N -f -L` command, and look for the number in the second column (usually about five digits). This number is the associated job ID. To kill these jobs, type `kill ##### ##### #####`, where the numbers are the Job IDs for all the rows containing `ssh -N -f -L`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type `ps aux | grep spydur` to confirm those jobs are no longer present. If successful, go back and repeat `ssh -N -f -L ####:spdr59:#### username@spydur`, making sure to only do it once. If you don't get the same 'Address already in use' error, then you should be good to log into Spydur from your Browser!\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Browser not loading but everything else seemed to work\n",
    "\n",
    "Every once in a while, you'll log in, `qsub` will work with no problems, `ssh -N -f -L` will work with no problems, but your browser just won't load Jupyter Notebook. First, on the Terminal signed into Spydur, type `squeue` and confirm there is a job running for your Jupyter Notebook. If not, but `qsub` worked, then it may be the case that Spydur is super busy, and your Jupyter Notebook job is still waiting to be run. If you do see your job running, however, take a look in the **yourfirstname_jupyter.sh.e####** file correlated to your job. If the port number in the link does not match the default port number you have, it's likely that another Spydur user was using your port number, so your job switched to a new port number. If so, identify the new port number in the **yourfirstname_jupyter.sh.e####** file, and run `ssh -N -f -L ####:spdr59:#### username@spydur` with the new port number on your other Terminal screen. The next time you login and run Jupyter Notebook, you should assume your port number is back to the default port number. But you can always check the new **yourfirstname_jupyter.sh.e####** to confirm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every once in a while, you hit `qsub` too many times and you ended up running more than one Jupyter Notebook. This usually isn't a problem, as your initial notebook with the default port is still running. But you might have multiple **yourfirstname_jupyter.sh.e####** files, which may get confusing. However, if you see multiple Jupyter Notebook jobs running when you check `squeue`, you can always type `scancel #####` where your number if the Job ID of your Jupyter Notebook. This will kill the Jupyter Notebook job running on Spydur. \n",
