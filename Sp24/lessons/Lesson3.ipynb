    "The main goal of today's lesson is to give you the tools for automating your code to run over large amounts of data, and provide conditional statements that will let you do different things to your data depending on your conditions. The major grammatical structure we will use involves the following:\n",

    "1. **if**\n",
    "2. **for**\n",
    "3. **while**\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective, when you begin programming, is to make the computer do your work for you. Instead of normalizing that microarray data or computing that crystal structure fit with a pocket calculator and a bucket of coffee, you want to be able to say, 'Computer, do my work,' and then have it done. Of course, you'd have to say it a little more clearly than that -- for instance, to pick out over-expressed membrane proteins from microarray data, you could tell the computer that for each gene in the genome:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"If the protein is located in the membrane, tell me if that protein's expression level under a given set of experimental conditions [stored in column 2, for example] is 5-fold or more greater than the expression level under control conditions [stored in column 4, for example].\"\n",

    "    A: if\n",
    "\n",
    "The **if statement** is one of the most fundamental components of programming, and it is found in some form or another in every general-purpose programming language (and nearly all specialized ones, too). It simply tells the computer to execute a block of code if a given statement is true. If the statement is false, the code is skipped. Although the concept is simple, conditional statements like **if** allow your programs to make decisions on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how can we ask the above question about every protein in our dataset of 5, or 20, or 10,000 proteins? Or, we have a raster with over 10,000 pixels? \n",
    "\n",
    "The really great thing about computers is their ability to do things over and over again really quickly, without getting bored. It's easy for us to do stuff on a handful of data points, but more than a couple dozen (or two, depending on how much patience we have) and we'd really start wishing the computer was doing it for us. (Prof Spera's favorite mental game with ArcGIS is: \"Do I click all the buttons 40 times, or do I take the time to code it?\" And usually, when she chooses 'click the buttons 40 times' she wishes she's coded it because she will inevitably be redoing whatever she did more than once).\n",
    "\n",
    "Every programming language has a way to do this, looping over a section of code multiple times. Python has two kinds of loops: the **for** loop and the **while** loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, anything you can do with one you should be able to do with the other somehow, but it's often a lot cleaner to pick the appropriate one for the situation. Hopefully once you've seen how each one works, it will be reasonably obvious which one is best for any given job at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the **if** statement, you can now introduce logic into your scripts, and with **for** and **while** loops, you introduce repetition into your scripts. By the end of today's lesson, you will have the foundational core to write code for almost anything you can imagine (though perhaps not with the greatest efficiency...that will come!). "

The mistake in these cases are often due to a mistake in the reasoning on how the program is working. These errors are much harder to solve because there are no handy errors to let us know something is wrong!

Thus, computation is a methodological skill that assists in answering your biological questions - don't forget that!

    "To state the question more concretely, if we were counting the number of bases between every adenine (A), what is the longest distance between two As? Two Gs/Cs/Ts?  Which of these four sets shows the longest distance? This in and of itself might not seem useful, but it is a great exercise to demonstrate the logic to employ, how to use nested loops. And if we think about the biology just a little bit, we can see potential applications - for instance, it is very relevant to think about the distance between two genes, perhaps by locating the distance between two gene promoters."

Write out to yourself what is occurring for the first few iterations. Use **print()** and **break** to print what each variable is for the first few iterations and check it against what you thought to make sure you really understand. \n",
