    "We have learned about different data types, some things you can do with these data types, and some of the basic structure (conditionals and loops) that helps us write useful code in Lessons 1-3. We have also learned about useful modules (e.g. **pandas**, **matplotlib**, **numpy**, **cartopy**) for working with large datasets and visualizing graphs/maps. Today, we will look at some tools for processing text in Python, and learn how to read and write to files more generally. This is particularly useful if the data files you are using are not in a structure that easily translates to Dataframes, i.e. not in a clean, tabular format. In the end, we will share a few final thoughts on organizign your code and minimizing/troubleshooting errors.  \n",

    "Systematically manipulating large text files is one of the most common tasks you will encounter. The most basic tools for this task are the built-in Python string methods. These allow us to convert between strings and lists, test the properties of strings, and modify strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "A reminder that many types of objects have special built-in functions. We call these endemic functions *methods*, and in a broader discussion of objected-oriented programming practice and theory, we would have much, much more to say about them. However, we're not getting into the object-oriented universe or philosophy here, so you'll have to take as explanation simply that some objects are so routinely manipulated with the same sorts of operations that it pays to have functions dedicated to their processing. In the case of strings and files today, we'll see the *methods* that routinely operate on these types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas a *function* is written to accept *arguments* and process those *arguments*, a *method* processes the object to which it belongs and is *called* differently. Whereas a *function* such as `print` is called by typing `print(\"whatever you want\")`, etc, a *method* is called by typing a period and the name of the *method* at the end of the object. For example, if *print* were a *method*, it would be called like this: **string_variable.print()**. Notice that there are still **()** at the end of the name of the *method*, and *methods* can accept *arguments* just like *functions*. As a reminder, we've already seen many methods, e.g. the list *methods* **append()** and **extend()** in previous lessons. \n",

With writing files, Python may not make the changes you stipulate right away, so if you plan to evaluate the contents of the file you're writing in the same script (or for instance use that file for something else during the run of that script), it is wise to close the filehandle to ensure that all the write operations you've requested are performed. Python will close any files at the end of the program's execution, so in most cases, this is unlikely to be a problem, but again in some situations as described above, it can be a problem. Thus, I again encourage finishing out opening any file with the **close** method. \n",

    "While we're on the subject, it is almost never a good idea to write to a file then read from it in the same script. When your data is in the form of Python objects those objects are stored in memory, and accessing data stored in *memory is 6 to 100,000 times faster than a hard disk*. We have not talked much about errors or code organization yet, but as your scripts get more advanced and you are dealing with larger text files, the memory your script uses and speed it runs is incredibly important, so it is good to start thinking of how to write code that uses little memory and is efficient. Effective troubleshooting for low memory, high speed code is super useful to coders!"

    "\"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.\" – Brian W. Kernighan\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's be honest, most of us aren't perfect. And in our zen self-awareness, we are well-served to be sensitive to our predispositions to err in particular ways. We are probably even better served to listen to the computer when it tells us we've made a big mistake. Python can be quite good at communicating our flaws to us, if only we're receptive to the constructive criticism in its spartanly high-contrast black and white print.\n",
    "\n",
    "This morning we're going to look at common sources of error, see what to look for as feedback from Python, and learn a couple of tricks to both obviate or track down bugs, should they occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're very lucky, an error will cause Python to give up right away, while others will cause insidious bugs that sneak through unnoticed until you present your work in lab meeting and someone calls out you on your exciting, but seemingly impossible (and ultimately bogus) result.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, the errors that don't give an immediate error are called **logical errors**, while those that give immediate errors are called **syntax errors** or **runtime errors**. [This link](https://rollbar.com/blog/python-errors-and-how-to-handle-them/) gives a more in-depth run-down. You've already had to deal with these, by the very fact that you have been coding for the last five lessons. Here, we will talk about them explicitly. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Logical errors** are the hardest to fix, as you have no aid as you're executing the script. Your code worked, but perhaps not as you intended. Thus, the problem is *logical* - you need to figure out why what your brain is thinking is not matching what the computer is 'thinking'. Logical errors are found by going through the script and making sure each part is printing what you think it should be printing, and they are easier to fix as you gain better intuition about how different data types and functions work. However, even then it can be difficult to find the dumb slicing or data typing mistake. There are some strategies that if you always employ, will minimize the amount of errors or at least help you catch them early in writing code. \n",

    "You can save yourself lots of time by testing frequently. Debugging 100 lines of code is often more than 10 times as hard as debugging 10 lines. Writing a ton of code that generates output without checking if each component works individually does NOT make you a coding rock star; it makes you sloppy. Organize your code into sections, where you have a sub-goal for each section. For instance, you could have a section for inputting data into a variable from a file, a section for subsetting the data for what you want, and then a section for visualizing your final data. Checking that each subsection works will be easier than making no subsections and looking across all your code.\n",

    "\"Errors should never pass silently.\" -- The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters\n",

    "One of the easiest ways to debug code is to print out the value of variables at the point things start going wrong. Of course, if you knew where things were going wrong, you would probably know what was going wrong in the first place, so to find this, a divide-and-conquer approach is often fastest. Start out by putting a bunch of distinguishable `print` statements in throughout your code, then narrow things down gradually until you're right at the broken line of code. Having subsections of code from Strategic Initiative 1 gives you great places to add `print` statements, to check if each subsection is working correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's not a bad idea to include these `print` statements in moderation before you need them. If you think there will be a subset of your data that will fail a logical test, set up your **if** and **else** statements to report the incidence of failure.\n",

    "It's always important to comment your code. The [Python Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#comments) has some good recommendations about comments. Anything you did that required some thinking on your part should ideally be commented, since you might come back to the code weeks or months later and have forgotten why you did it that way. Also try to keep your comments up to date with the code. While this is important if future coders are adapting your code for some use, it's also important for you!

By now, you may have already noticed that some of these datasets take a lot of time to load or process through our script. When you're troubleshooting, this can be a pain. If you're working with a large dataset, it's always a good idea to take a subset of the data to work with as you're writing the script. One way is making a smaller file using `head` in Linux to work with as a test datafile, so you grab the first N rows to use. This is often the fastest and easiest way, but note that it may not always show all the variety of what you might see in the dataset, so grabbing enough so you feel like you have good representation might be useful. \n",
