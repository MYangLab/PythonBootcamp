Tabs and line breaks might be a problem, however, say if you wanted to use a backslash in your string.

    "Python is a language, and inside every language there are different types of words. In English, we have parts of speech like nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. In Python, we have packages like Numpy, Scipy, pandas, etc. Each package has a specific purpose, `numpy` = matrix math, `scipy` = Science-based analysis, `pandas` = spreadsheet operations (like Excel). Each part of speech has many different categories and words. For example, we have abstract nouns, proper nouns, collective nouns, common nouns, but they are all types of nouns. In a Python package like Numpy, we have different commands that tell us what is happening in our Python sentence. Thus, another way of thinking of packages is as a set of Python code written by someone else with ready to go commands (i.e. functions) we might want to use related to the topic (e.g. `numpy` will have many functions and data types useful for matric math).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The code below is an example of a script that uses the `numpy` package. `import numpy` allows us to access the package, so to use a `numpy` function, we add the `import numpy` line to tell Python to look for that package. That's all you need to know about `import` for now. "

I said `(5)`, so Numpy makes a range of numbers that is 5 elements long, starting at 0. The `print(x)` statement in Line 4 shows us the result of this command, `[0 1 2 3 4]`. \n",

    "Note that `numpy` creates a new data structure, known as an `array`. It is like lists, except many `numpy` functions can be applied, allowing quick matrix algebra calculations.
