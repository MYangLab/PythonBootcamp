    "Welcome to the Yang Lab Python (and Linux) lessons. You will learn the basics of python in the context of using it for genetic analyses. This course is going to be presented in jupyter notebook - it is not a requirement to use the notebook, but it highly recommended as the notebook is a useful way of organizing code.  I use jupyter notebooks regularly for my research. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these lessons are directly taken or adapted from a python bootcamp at UC Berkeley that I helped to teach from 2012-2016. I have also taught these lessons the summer of 2017 at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. \n",

    "### Expectations for working through these lessons\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the lessons is to create an environment for you to intensively work on developing your python programming skills and give you a crash course in the basics of the language. By the end of the course, you will not be an expert on python, but you should be able to write simple scripts and have the groundwork and general vocabulary to effectively use the internet and/or other resources to teach you fancier tricks. Most importantly, you should be able to ask yourself a question and start envisioning what ways you can write code that will help you arrive at an answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the time you complete everything in these lessons, you may have already started or will begin to start a project where YOU will write scripts to rearrange data into new formats ready to be used in various software!\n",

    "Keep in mind - learning to code is like learning a new language. It takes lots of practice, and it continuously feels hard and unintuitive until suddenly, it starts sticking. Just keep trying and **asking questions**--it will get easier and easier!\n",

For instance, the Python Code Visualization will likely be useful as you start learning to use for loops in Python - they help walk you through the logic of how a computer goes through the code.

    "## Basic Tools Required\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we touch any python, let's go over some of the main tools you will use as you write in python, as well as another language - Linux. \n",
    "\n",
    "The shell is the the way you interact with your operating system. Most of you are used to the graphical user interface (GUI) you see when you turn on a computer - clicking the start button allows you to access a folder, which contains files that you double click to open within the relevant default application. However, there is a command line user interface (CLI) that is very useful as well. Both Linux and Mac operating systems use the CLI **Terminal**, in which we use the Linux language for navigation. In Windows operating system, this CLI is the **Command Prompt**, which uses a different language. However, Windows 10 and higher now have a Terminal software installed that uses Linux. If you have an older Windows interface, installation of other CLIs like cygwin or MobaXTerm will allow you to use UNIX in a Windows computer - let me know if you need this. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next vital piece in writing python code is a text editor. Your python code is usually written to a text file ending in \".py\", and then you can use the Linux commands to access and run the python script from your shell (Terminal). Sometimes, you may also want to use an interpreter, or a program that allows you to directly execute commands without calling on a script you save to file. Here, we will gain familiarity with the Linux language, and learn how to use jupyter notebook. Jupyter Notebook is useful because you can take your own notes in it (like what you see right now), you can use it as an interpreter), AND you can write files directly to folders and then go to the CLI to run the script. Lots of options! Jupyter notebook can also be used as a shell (i.e. you can also run Linux commands), making it a powerful one stop shop for all the main tools you use to begin coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, make sure you are a user on the Spydur cluster. From there, you will be able to open jupyter notebooks following the instructions I provide in our 'Using Spydur' documentation on Slack. "

    "[Jupter notebook](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) was previously known as IPython notebook, and it is the main tool we will be using to write and execute our scripts. Not only is it useful for developing our scripts, but it is also a great organizer and actual notebook. All of the lectures, including this one, are provided in a notebook, so you will get many examples of its utility. While we do not explore all of the functions of the notebook, we highlight some of the basics here so you can navigate and write in these notebooks easily. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The easiest way of accessing the notebook on Spydur is how I described it above. There are also ways to install Jupyter Notebook on your computer - installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) is probably the easiest way to do this smoothly. \n",
    "* What opens is a web-based user interface with the files in the directory you opened in terminal (or your home directory when opening through Anaconda Navigator). Going to the top right and clicking \"New\" followed by \"Python 3\" under 'Notebook' will open your first jupyter notebook (ends in .ipynb) like the one we observe here. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Note that won Spydur, you set a time in the Jupyter Notebook script you ran (remember `qsub yourname_jupyter.sh`?). The default I put in is 12 hours. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If you want to cancel the notebook on Spydur, type `squeue`, you will see a list of running jobs, like what is pasted below:\n",
    "```\n",
    "64513     yang2 jupyter-    myang  R      23:53      1 spdr60\n",
    "```\n",
    "This says my job is in the partition 'yang2' (also called spdr60), has run for ~24 minutes, and the job's ID is 64513. \n",
    "You can type `scancel JOBIDNUMBER` to stop Jupyter Notebook from running. If you do this, but you want to restart it, you must go to /scratch/myang_shared/ and restart the job using `qsub`. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Remember that on a local Terminal on your computer, you will need to put in `ssh -NfL localhost:####:localhost:#### yourusername@spydur` to connect the notebook to your computer's browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Each of these squares where we can write text is called a cell. By default each cell is a python interpreter. Going to \"Cell\"->\"Cell Type\"->\"Markdown\" turns it into a text displayer, allowing you to write just plain notes, as this cell current does. I will not be teaching all the different options for Markdown, but [this page](http://nestacms.com/docs/creating-content/markdown-cheat-sheet) provides some of the formatting you might be interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The top bar includes many different options. While the notebook usually automatically saves periodically, you have a 'save option', followed by options to insert new cells, move cells around, and run the cells. Holding Shift+Enter will also run the active cell. You can also switch the cell format in the dropdown box. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Magic commands: One useful aspect of the notebook are [magic commands](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/interactive/magics.html). We won't delve into magic commands here, but there are a few I use often, particularly %%bash and %%writefile\n",
