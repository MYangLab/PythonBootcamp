The official python lingo for something that can be operated on as an ordered series of sub-elements is a 'sequence'. While several python data types are sequences, strings are the only one we'll deal with today. In the next couple of days, however, some of the notation you learn today will come back in other contexts.\n",

Slices look like indices, except with two numbers separated by a colon. The slice starts at the index of the first number, and ends at the index before the second number, so in the example above name[7:11] would be ' A. ' (middle initial, and both flanking spaces). This lets us do handy things like:\n",
