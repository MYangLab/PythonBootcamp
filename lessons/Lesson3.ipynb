    "The objective, when you begin programming, is to make the computer do your work for you. Instead of normalizing that microarray data or computing that crystal structure fit with a pocket calculator and a bucket of coffee, you want to be able to say, 'Computer, do my work,' and then have it done. Of course, you'd have to say it a little more clearly than that -- for instance, to pick out over-expressed membrane proteins from microarray data, you could tell the computer that for each gene in the genome:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"If the protein is located in the membrane, tell me if that protein's expression level under a given set of experimental conditions [stored in column 2, for example] is 5-fold or more greater than the expression level under control conditions [stored in column 4, for example].\"\n",

    "Indeed, the **if statement** is one of the most fundamental components of programming, and it is found in some form or another in every general-purpose programming language (and nearly all specialized ones, too). It simply tells the computer to execute a block of code if a given statement is true. If the statement is false, the code is skipped. Although the concept is simple, conditional statements like if allow your programs to make decisions on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how can we ask the above question about every protein in our dataset of 5, or 20, or 10,000 proteins? The really great thing about computers is their ability to do things over and over again really quickly, without getting bored. It's easy for us to do stuff on a handful of data points, but more than a couple dozen (or two, depending on how much patience we have) and we'd really start wishing the computer was doing it for us. Every programming language has a way to do this, looping over a section of code multiple times. Python has two kinds of loops: the **for** loop and the **while** loop.\n",

    "In principle, anything you can do with one you should be able to do with the other somehow, but it's often a lot cleaner to pick the appropriate one for the situation. Hopefully once you've seen how each one works, it will be reasonably obvious which one is best for any given job at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the **if** statement, you can now introduce logic into your scripts, and with **for** and **while** loops, you introduce repetition into your scripts. Thus, with the completion of today's lesson, you will have the foundational core to write code for almost anything you can imagine (though perhaps not with the greatest efficiency...that will come!).

    "The key pieces of syntax here are the **if**, the condition that we would like to evaluate (note: the condition is expressed within angle brackets **<>** for emphasis in this example, but angle brackets are not used in real code), the colon **:** that signifies the end of the logical test, and the indentation for the things to do below the first line of the statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss what makes things **True** in a minute, but for now we should focus on the syntax. Beyond the **if** and **\":\"**, Python will execute all of the following indented code. Indentation is the signal to the interpreter that this block of code is under the control of the **if** statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking of decision making, we could use this syntax to write a program that spares us the trouble of deciding what to eat each each day. The scenario is \"I need a script that will help me decide what I can eat today\". To plan out this code, I think about the steps I need.\n",

    "Below is another version where I changed my conditions and how I printed the final outcome. Notice here that though all the code works great, the result is nonsensical - if you had $20, you most certainly could also eat chicken parmesan - this type of error is a logical error. Logical errors are errors that do not break the code - that is, the rules of coding are not broken, but your output is not what you intended. The mistake in these cases are often due to a mistake in the reasoning on how the program is working. These errors are much harder to solve because there are no handy errors to let us know something is wrong! We'll learn more about how to build in error troubleshooting in a later lesson, but a good first step is printing your variables out a lot, and testing whether what gets printed matches what you would have expected based on your understanding of the code. \n",

You may be converting from one sequence to another in code, but whether your final result is BIOLOGICALLY MEANINGFUL will always be rooted in your understanding of biology. Thus, computation is a methodological skill that assists in answering your biological questions - don't forget that! While you may spend a lot of time figuring out code, it's just as important to remember you spent valuable time developing the question and background the code is being developed for. \n"
