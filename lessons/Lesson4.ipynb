    "# Manipulating Files and Processing Text\n",
    "\n",
    "We have learned about different data types, some things you can do with these data types, and some of the basic structure (conditionals and loops) that helps us write useful code in Lessons 1-3. Today, we will work more on how to use python to process text, and begin to read in files, since in most code, you will not be making up your own data to process, but you will be retrieving them from already prepared files! Lastly, we will learn to write to files. Often, you may want to print out the final output to a text file for further analysis or processing. \n",

    "## Basic Text Processing\n",
    "Systematically manipulating large text files is one of the most common tasks you will encounter. The most basic tools for this task are the built-in Python string methods. These allow us to convert between strings and lists, test the properties of strings, and modify strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Informative Interlude: getting ahead of ourselves with methods vs. functions\n",
    "Next class, we're going to learn all about writing our own *functions* to process information. These will be sets of logic that consider variables and manipulate them according to the logic that we assign. In a sense, *functions* are formally encapsulated manifestations of the sorts of things we've been writing with our scripts all week.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, as we're going to see with strings, many types of objects have special built-in functions. We call these endemic functions *methods*, and in a broader discussion of objected-oriented programming practice and theory, we would have much, much more to say about them. However, we're not getting into the object-oriented universe or philosophy here, so you'll have to take as explanation simply that some objects are so routinely manipulated with the same sorts of operations that it pays to have functions dedicated to their processing. In the case of strings and files today, we'll see the *methods* that routinely operate on these types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas a *function* is written to accept *arguments* and process those *arguments*, a *method* processes the object to which it belongs and is *called* differently. Whereas a *function* such as `print` is called by typing `print(\"whatever you want\")`, etc, a *method* is called by typing a period and the name of the *method* at the end of the object. For example, if *print* were a *method*, it would be called like this: **string_variable.print()**. Notice that there are still **()** at the end of the name of the *method*, and *methods* can accept *arguments* just like *functions*. If all this seems eerily familiar, it may be because we've already seen the list *methods* **append()** and **extend()** in previous lessons. Apologies if this seems out of order and confusing, but we'll see how these concepts interoperate in more detail as the progress in these lessons. \n",

    "Lastly, a note on **close** and writing files. With writing files, Python may not make the changes you stipulate right away, so if you plan to evaluate the contents of the file you're writing in the same script (or for instance use that file for something else during the run of that script), it is wise to close the filehandle to ensure that all the write operations you've requested are performed. Python will close any files at the end of the program's execution, so in most cases, this is unlikely to be a problem, but again in some situations as described above, it can be a problem. Thus, I again encourage finishing out opening any file with the **close** method. \n",
    "\n",
    "While we're on the subject, it is almost never a good idea to write to a file then read from it in the same script. When your data is in the form of Python objects those objects are stored in memory, and accessing data stored in *memory is 6 to 100,000 times faster than a hard disk*. We have not talked much about errors or code organization yet, but as your scripts get more advanced and you are dealing with larger text files, the memory your script uses and speed it runs is incredibly important, so it is good to start thinking of how to write code that uses little memory and is efficient. We will discuss this more in future lessons as we start bringing all the basics together!"
