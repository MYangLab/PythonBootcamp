    "# Lesson 6: Smart Practices with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you have most of the groundwork you need to write basic scripts, and much of the rest is practicing and building up your knowledge of different functions and modules until the logic and vocabulary becomes second nature. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today's lesson will explore dealing with errors while scripting and methods of outlining your code to make sure the complex script you're creating runs as you plan. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.\" â€“ Brian W. Kernighan\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's be honest, most of us aren't perfect. And in our zen self-awareness, we are well-served to be sensitive to our predispositions to err in particular ways. We are probably even better served to listen to the computer when it tells us we've made a big mistake. Python can be quite good at communicating our flaws to us, if only we're receptive to the constructive criticism in its spartanly high-contrast black and white print.\n",
    "\n",
    "This morning we're going to look at common sources of error, see what to look for as feedback from Python, and learn a couple of tricks to both obviate or track down bugs, should they occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're very lucky, an error will cause Python to give up right away, while others will cause insidious bugs that sneak through unnoticed until you present your work in lab meeting and someone calls out you on your exciting, but seemingly impossible (and ultimately bogus) result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The errors that don't give an immediate error are called **logical errors**, while those that give immediate errors are called **syntax errors** or **runtime errors**. [This link](https://rollbar.com/blog/python-errors-and-how-to-handle-them/) gives a more in-depth run-down. You've already had to deal with these, by the very fact that you have been coding for the last five lessons. Here, we will talk about them explicitly. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Logical errors** are the hardest to fix, as you have no aid as you're executing the script. Your code worked, but perhaps not as you intended. Thus, the problem is *logical* - you need to figure out why what your brain is thinking is not matching what the computer is 'thinking'. Logical errors are found by going through the script and making sure each part is printing what you think it should be printing, and they are easier to fix as you gain better intuition about how different data types and functions work. However, even then it can be difficult to find the dumb slicing or data typing mistake. There are some strategies that if you always employ, will minimize the amount of errors or at least help you catch them early in writing code. \n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Strategic Initiative 1: Test Early, Test Often\n",
    "\n",
    "There's an approach to software engineering called \"Test Driven Development (TDD)\". In that way of doing things, before you write a function that does something, you write code that tests it, often in a separate file. It's really convenient to use modules to do this, where you could have a `test.py` file that imports the relevant functions from your other modules and tests them on as many cases as it can. This also has the advantage that you notice fairly quickly when your new code breaks something that used to work. Especially in scientific programming, this isn't always practical to do, but the general ideas hold: testing is good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you don't do TDD, you can save yourself lots of time by testing frequently. Debugging 100 lines of code is often more than 10 times as hard as debugging 10 lines. Writing a ton of code that generates output without checking if each component works individually does NOT make you a coding rock star; it makes you sloppy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Strategic Initiative 2: Be Verbose\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Errors should never pass silently.\" -- The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the easiest ways to debug code is to print out the value of variables at the point things start going wrong. Of course, if you knew where things were going wrong, you would probably know what was going wrong in the first place, so to find this, a divide-and-conquer approach is often fastest. Start out by putting a bunch of distinguishable `print` statements in throughout your code, then narrow things down gradually until you're right at the broken line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not a bad idea to include these `print` statements in moderation before you need them. If you think there will be a subset of your data that will fail a logical test, set up your **if** and **else** statements to report the incidence of failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in nested loops, I often will print the variables belonging to each `for loop`, making sure that what is printed out is what I expect. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.\" --Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs Hal Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman\n",
    "\n",
    "As you get better at coding, you will start to take shortcuts and combine lines. As soon as something doesn't behave as you expect, you should decompose your compound statements, as this is a common source of error.\n",

Lists have been optimized such that you can add to them, and they don't slow down computing power as they get longer.

    "`internet` and `games` are not built into python - we'll have to write the functions in them ourselves eventually. However, now we have a better idea of what these functions should look like, and what they need to do. For now, let's use a new concept to fill these functions in and allow us to run and test this code: the statement __pass__. It's pretty simple: it does nothing. Although this sounds somewhat pointless, in this case it allows you to write little function stubs without Python (or your text editor) complaining. However, it pops up in other places as well, usually as a shortcut where you mean to write more code later. This could be in an __if__ or __else__ statement or while raising an exception. Each of those cases requires something after the colon for it to be valid Python, and **pass** is a valid way to put in something that does nothing. We won't cover those applications here, but keep them in mind while you're programming: we encourage you to try it out.\n",

The next three lessons mostly focus on introducing you to several useful modules, including ones for plotting data (**matplotlib**), statistical analyses (**scipy.stats**), using arrays (**numpy**), and running UNIX commands from python (**subprocess**). We may not get to these this semester, which is okay! With what you have from Lessons 1-5, you have plenty to begin parsing through data, setting up input files, and calculating basic stats for analysis. Most importantly, if you want to do something you don't know yet, you have the beginning logic and vocabulary to begin looking for more resources yourself from the world wide web. Have fun!"
