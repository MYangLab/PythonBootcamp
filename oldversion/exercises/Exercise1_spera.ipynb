    "It's important to undertand that python is a programming language made of modules - and modules are just sets of related code that contain variables, definitions and instructions. Modules are often organized into packages. Python comes with some packages built in that support your everyday tasks like reading and writing files, and then there are special packages like 'pandas' which helps you organize data, and 'sciPy' for statistics, 'matplotlib' for graphing, and, you guessed it 'ArcPy' that allow you to work with spatial data. I used the [spatial analysis](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/arcpy/spatial-analyst/what-is-the-spatial-analyst-module.htm) module in the ArcPy python package almost every day in graduate school. We'll delve into Arcpy a little later because you essentially need to have access to/use ArcGIS Pro open to use it. There are 'free' python spatial analysis packages like GDAL that allow you to do learn the basics of python that we will later apply to ArcGIS. \n",
