Values can be anything, any type of data, and they don't have to be the same in a {key:value} pair. \n",

Each part of speech has many different categories and words. For example, we have abstract nouns, proper nouns, collective nouns, common nouns, but they are all types of nouns. In a Python package like Numpy, we have different *commands* that tell us what is happening in our Python sentence. \n"
